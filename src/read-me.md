# Google Fonts

Chingu Voyage Pre-work Solo front-end project. The participant is responsible for coding the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get the structure, styling, and functionality up and running.
**Requirements**

_Structure_

- [ ] Header with minor navigation
- [ ] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation
- [ ] Main section for the font cards
- [ ] Font cards which display the Font Name, the sample text, and an add button
- [ ] Back-to-top button to click and scroll back up to the top
- [ ] Footer section with your developer information

_Functionality_

- [ ] Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text in each font card
- [ ] The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input
- [ ] Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [ ] Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should reset the page as if the page were reloaded _(do not actually reset the page)_
- [ ] On load, the page should display fonts sorted by current popularity, as returned by the Google Fonts Developer API _(see below)_
- [ ] The search feature should be fully functional and should display matching fonts (it's up to you if you want to do this via a 'submit' or through onchange)
- [ ] When the search input is cleared (via reset button or manually), the fonts should automaticaly display sorted by poplarity again

## API Information

Consider designing the app so that the Google Fonts Developer API is only called once during the app lifetime.

This project utilizes the [**Google Fonts API**](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) and the [**Google Fonts Developer API**](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). You will need to register for a free api key in order to complete this project as calls to the developer api are severely capped without one.

Please do _not_ use the Google Web Font Loader for Tier 2.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
